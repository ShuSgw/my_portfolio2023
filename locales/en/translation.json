The technologies I used through working here were HTML, SCSS, jQuery, and rarely VB.net. There was no version control system before I joined, so introducing git and GitHub was a significant improvement for the dev team. I worked on the Shopify project to modernize their websites, so the experience involved with this was great for me."

I was primarily responsible for website creation and maintenance using WordPress and other front-end development technologies. As technology stacks, I create websites using HTML, SCSS, jQuery, PHP, and WordPress. Moreover, I used PHP and GAS as the backend to create a simple reservation system that links the google calendar API. In addition, introducing 'wordmove' simplifies their website's production management and development to keep their projects running smoothly."
