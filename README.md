By default, the Portfolio Minimal Starter has a `content` directory at the root of your Gatsby site. There, you can edit the theme settings and add content for your sections. To learn more about it, look at the [Readme of Portfolio Minimal](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal/tree/main/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal#readme).
